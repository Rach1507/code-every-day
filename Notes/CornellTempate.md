### Topic: What Are Components? And Why Is React All About Them?

### Recall

components

### Notes

a component is a piece of reusable code that represents a part of a user interface

. Components are used to render, manage, and update the UI elements in your application

- React embraces this concept of components.
  reusability aspect :
  DRY
  and because it allows us to separate our concerns.:
  a separation of concerns helps us
  with keeping our code base small and manageable
  instead of having one large file
- React is all about these components.
  You build these individual components
  and then you tell React how to compose them together
  into a final user interface

- React is all about splitting your application into small building blocks, small components where every building block, every component,

has a clear task and therefore your code

stays maintainable and manageable

and React, the library, will do the heavy lifting

of rendering something on the screen

and of combining all your code.

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript

are about building user interfaces as well.

But I also mentioned in the first course section

that we use libraries like React

because that simplifies building those user interfaces.

You won't have to focus on all the nitty-gritty details

and it will be less error prone

if you use something like React

because you will be able to focus

on your core business logic

that makes up your application

instead of having to focus on the actual steps

of updating the page when something happens somewhere.

# Notes

The Cornell Note-taking System is a popular and effective method for organizing and summarizing information during lectures, readings, or any other form of learning.

<aside>Note's Layout</aside>

The Cornell method offers a specific layout for each page of notes. The note is devided into three sections: 
- **Cue/Question Column (Left)** â€” is used to write down questions, keywords, or cues related to the content you're recording in the main notes section.
- **Note-taking Column (Right)** â€” here you write your main notes during the lecture or reading. This section should contain the most critical information, main ideas, supporting details, and explanations.
- **Summary Section (Bottom)** â€” here you write a concise summary of the main points covered in your notes.

<aside>Note-taking Process</aside>

* Start by listening or reading actively, and jot down the main ideas and supporting details in the Note-taking Column.
* Use abbreviations and bullet points to keep your notes concise and easy to review.
* In the Cue/Question Column, write down questions or cues that correspond to the material you're noting in the right column. These questions can be used as study prompts later.
* If you come across concepts or ideas that you don't understand fully, make a note of it and try to clarify them later through research or by asking your instructor.

<aside>Review and Study</aside>

* After the lecture or reading, review your notes as soon as possible to reinforce the information in your memory.
* Use the Cue/Question Column to cover the right-hand side of your notes and quiz yourself based on the cues or questions you wrote down.
* Reflect on the material and try to answer the questions from memory. This active recall helps improve retention.
* Check your answers and understanding in the Note-taking Column and fill in any gaps or correct any mistakes in your summary section.

# Summary

<summary>Write a concise summary here</summary>
The Cornell Note-taking System is effective because it encourages active engagement during the note-taking process and provides a structured way to review and study the material later. It is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their note-taking and learning efficiency.
