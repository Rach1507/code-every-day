Get datamodel
Get mockup/figma

Break  ui into components
    - usually intunitive from data model and mockup 
    - build the heirarchy 

build a static version 
    that renders your data model (data model passed as prop to parent component)
    without interactivity  
    dont use states - State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time.
    build top-down / bottom -up  :  In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.
