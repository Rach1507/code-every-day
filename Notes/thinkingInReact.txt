Break  ui into components
    - usually intunitive from data model and mockup 
    - build the heirarchy 

build a static version 
    that renders your data model (data model passed as prop to parent component)
    without interactivity  
    dont use states - State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time.
    build top-down / bottom -up  :  In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up.

Step 3: Find the minimal but complete representation of UI state 

- The most important principle for structuring state is to keep it DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
- Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else on-demand. 

Now think of all of the pieces of data in this example application:

The original list of products
The search text the user has entered
The value of the checkbox
The filtered list of products
Which of these are state? Identify the ones that are not:

Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!N


Step 4: Identify where your state should live
For each piece of state in your application:

Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
Find their closest common parent component—a component above them all in the hierarchy.
Decide where the state should live:
Often, you can put the state directly into their common parent.
You can also put the state into some component above their common parent.
If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common parent component.


you need to pass these functions down to SearchBar:

function FilterableProductTable({ products }) {
  const [filterText, setFilterText] = useState('');
  const [inStockOnly, setInStockOnly] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar 
        filterText={filterText} 
        inStockOnly={inStockOnly}
        onFilterTextChange={setFilterText}
        onInStockOnlyChange={setInStockOnly} />
  );
}
