Question : how to improve performance of a webpage of a lot of images?

Answer: 
1. Loading optimizations:
   - Compression: Correct
   - Choosing the right format: Correct
   - Preloading: Correct
   - Lazy loading: Correct
   - Inlining critical images: Correct

2. Perceptive performance:
   - Showing skeleton screens: Correct
   - Progressive image loading: Correct

3. Viewport-based loading:
   - Loading images only when they're about to enter the viewport: Correct

Your answer is factually correct and covers a good range of techniques. You've addressed both actual performance improvements and perceived performance enhancements. The example you provided about not loading all images upfront for a series/movies catalog is a good practical application of viewport-based loading.

To make your answer even more comprehensive, you could also mention:

1. Using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve images from geographically closer servers
2. Implementing browser caching for images
3. Using modern image formats like WebP where supported
4. Responsive images using the `srcset` attribute to serve different sizes based on device capabilities

Overall, your answer is factually correct and provides a solid overview of image optimization techniques for web performance."
