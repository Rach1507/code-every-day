Key differences

Here are the key differences between a framework and a library:

Structure and Architecture: A framework provides a specific structure and architecture for building applications, while a library does not.
Comprehensive vs. Specific: A framework is a more comprehensive set of tools and features, while a library is a specific set of functionalities.
Conventions and Best Practices: A framework typically enforces specific conventions and best practices, while a library does not.
Control and Flexibility: A framework provides more control over the application's architecture and structure, while a library provides more flexibility in how you use it.
In summary

To illustrate the difference, consider the following analogy:

A library is like a set of LEGO bricks that you can use to build a specific part of a castle.
A framework is like a complete LEGO castle kit that provides a set of bricks, instructions, and a specific design for building the entire castle.
In the context of Angular and React, Angular is a framework that provides a comprehensive set of tools and a specific architecture for building applications, while React is a library that provides a set of components and tools for building user interfaces
