What is crossorigin?

Crossorigin is an attribute that can be added to HTML elements, such as the ' < script >' tag, to specify how the browser should handle cross-origin requests.

What is a cross-origin request?

A cross-origin request occurs when a web page requests a resource (e.g., a script, image, or stylesheet) from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the current web page. For example, if a web page at https://example.com requests a script from https://cdn.example.net, this is a cross-origin request.

What is the purpose of crossorigin?

The crossorigin attribute is used to specify whether the browser should execute the script with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enabled or not. CORS is a security feature that allows a web page to request resources from a different origin, while also ensuring that the browser enforces same-origin policy security restrictions.

What are the possible values of crossorigin?

The crossorigin attribute can have one of the following values:

anonymous: The browser will execute the script with CORS enabled, but without sending credentials (e.g., cookies, authentication headers).
use-credentials: The browser will execute the script with CORS enabled and send credentials.


-What happens if crossorigin is not specified?

If the crossorigin attribute is not specified, the browser will block the script from loading if it is from a different origin than the current web page. This is because the same-origin policy restricts web pages from accessing resources from a different origin.

Example of crossorigin in a script tag:

Here is an example of a script tag with the crossorigin attribute:

html

<script src="https://cdn.example.net/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></>


In this example, the script will be loaded from a different origin (https://cdn.example.net) and executed with CORS enabled, but without sending



The `crossorigin` attribute in a `<script>` tag (or other elements like `<link>` and `<img>`) is used to handle cross-origin requests, particularly in the context of security and privacy.

Here’s a breakdown of its purpose and usage:

### Purpose
When a script or resource is loaded from a different origin (domain) than the one hosting the page, there are potential security implications. The `crossorigin` attribute helps manage how these cross-origin requests are handled.

### Usage
The `crossorigin` attribute can have the following values:

1. **`anonymous`**: This is the default value. It means that no credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) are sent with the request. This setting helps prevent credentials from being sent unintentionally, which might be a security risk.

   ```html
   <script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
   ```

2. **`use-credentials`**: This setting sends credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication) with the request. This can be useful if the resource you're requesting needs to be authenticated or if you want to maintain a session.

   ```html
   <script src="https://example.com/script.js" crossorigin="use-credentials"></script>
   ```

### How It Works
- **Without `crossorigin`**: If you don’t use the `crossorigin` attribute, the browser may still make cross-origin requests, but it will handle them with default settings that depend on the specific browser and its security policies.
  
- **With `crossorigin`**: When specified, it tells the browser how to handle the request regarding credentials and how to process the response. For example, if you include the `crossorigin` attribute with the `anonymous` value, the browser will fetch the script without sending any cookies or authentication headers, and it will also ensure that the response does not include any sensitive information.

### Use Cases
- **Security**: It prevents potential security issues that might arise from including scripts from untrusted sources.
- **Caching**: It can influence how caching works, particularly in the context of using CDNs or other third-party resources.

### Example in Context
Here’s how you might use `crossorigin` with an external script:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.example.com/library.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Page content -->
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the script from `cdn.example.com` will be loaded without sending credentials. If the script requires credentials to function properly, you would use `crossorigin="use-credentials"` instead.
