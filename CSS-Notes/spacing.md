Margin

![Alt text](image-21.png)

If you use a percentage, the value will be calculated based on the width of your element's containing block.



MArgin : auto


 a value of auto will be equivalent to a value of 0 (which is the initial value for each margin property) or else whatever space is available on that side of the element.

 Margin collapse works by selecting the largest value of two adjoining elements with vertical margin set on the adjoining sides.

 Only block margins collapse, not inline (horizontal) margins.

 If you make an element absolutely positioned, using position: absolute, the margin will no longer collapse. The margin also won't collapse if you use the float property, too.
