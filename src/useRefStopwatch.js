/* 

use ref - 

state - but no rerender

retained between rerenders 

normal js object will be set to initial state during re render 

useRef returns {current : }

Mutable—you can modify and update current’s value outside of the rendering process.

You shouldn’t read (or write) the current value during rendering.
